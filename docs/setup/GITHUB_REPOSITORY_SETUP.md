# 🔧 GitHub Repository Setup

## ✅ Git Setup Complete!
Your local repository is ready with:
- ✅ **99 files** committed successfully
- ✅ **All your code** is staged and ready
- ✅ **Remote origin** configured for GitHub

## 🚨 Repository Not Found Issue

The repository `https://github.com/roxi12/Texasroadhouse.git` either doesn't exist or you need to authenticate.

### Option 1: Create Repository on GitHub (Recommended)

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com/roxi12
2. **Click "New Repository"** (green button)
3. **Repository Name**: `Texasroadhouse` (exactly this name)
4. **Settings**:
   - ✅ **Public** (so it can be deployed to Vercel)
   - ❌ **Don't** initialize with README (we already have one)
   - ❌ **Don't** add .gitignore (we already have one)
5. **Click "Create Repository"**

### Option 2: If Repository Already Exists

You might need to authenticate with GitHub:

1. **GitHub Desktop** (Easier):
   - Download: https://desktop.github.com/
   - Login with your GitHub account
   - Add existing repository from your folder
   - Push to GitHub

2. **Command Line** (Advanced):
   - You'll need a Personal Access Token
   - Or use SSH keys

## 🚀 After Creating Repository

Once the GitHub repository exists, I can push your code with this command:

```bash
& "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe" push -u origin main
```
