# ⚠️ Git Installation Required

## Your system doesn't have Git installed. Please follow these steps:

### Step 1: Download Git
1. Go to: **https://git-scm.com/downloads**
2. Click **"Download for Windows"**
3. Download the installer (Git-X.XX.X-64-bit.exe)

### Step 2: Install Git
1. Run the downloaded installer
2. **Important settings during installation:**
   - ✅ Use default settings for most options
   - ✅ When asked about "Adjusting your PATH environment":
     - Select **"Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software"**
   - ✅ When asked about line endings:
     - Select **"Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings"**
   - ✅ Use default terminal emulator

### Step 3: Restart Command Prompt/PowerShell
- Close your current terminal
- Open a new PowerShell/Command Prompt
- Navigate back to your project: `cd "C:\Users\Burhan\Desktop\New folder (2)"`

### Step 4: Verify Installation
```bash
git --version
```
You should see something like: `git version 2.xx.x`
