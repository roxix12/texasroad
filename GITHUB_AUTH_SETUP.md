# üîê GitHub Authentication Setup

## Issue: GitHub requires Personal Access Token (not password)

GitHub discontinued password authentication in 2021. You need a Personal Access Token (PAT).

## üöÄ Quick Solutions (Choose One)

### Option 1: Personal Access Token (5 minutes)

1. **Create Token**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click **"Generate new token"** ‚Üí **"Generate new token (classic)"**
   - **Note**: "Texas Roadhouse Deployment"
   - **Expiration**: 90 days (or No expiration)
   - **Scopes**: Select **"repo"** (gives full repository access)
   - Click **"Generate token"**
   - **‚ö†Ô∏è COPY THE TOKEN** (you won't see it again!)

2. **Use Token as Password**:
   - When Git asks for password, paste the token instead
   - Username: `roxi12` (or your GitHub username)
   - Password: `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx` (your token)

### Option 2: GitHub Desktop (Easiest - No tokens needed)

1. **Download**: https://desktop.github.com/
2. **Install and login** with your GitHub account
3. **Add existing repository**:
   - File ‚Üí Add Local Repository
   - Choose: `C:\Users\Burhan\Desktop\New folder (2)`
4. **Publish to GitHub**:
   - Click "Publish repository"
   - Make sure it's public
   - One-click upload!
